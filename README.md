# LD32
Ludum Dare 32 - theme 'An Unconventional Weapon'

## TODO

  * [ ] Come up with idea.
  * [ ] Integrate twodee library
  * [ ] Open window, blank screen
  * [ ] Main game loop

## Setup

Run:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

This installs the twodee lib to `lib/twodee`.  You'll need to make sure deps are
set up correctly.  Run:

	cd lib/twodee
	./scripts/setup.sh

To run `chromos`, execute the following from the project root:

	make run

## Brainstorming
